Cannot lookup OOS products within website (they get delisted but the page exists so the link is accessible)

Stock/not in stock:
MD: If the product is not seen in the products list as a whole, it is OOS
(basically, query with today's date as WHERE clause gets you all in-stock products @ current prices)
PrimeABGB: Has "Call for Price" or "Email for Price" products. # todo find how to find s/oos from search page direct (reduce page requests)
